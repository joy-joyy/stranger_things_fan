Why do people share fake news? Associations between the dark side of social media use and fake news sharing behavior
Abstract
The current study examines the associations of the dark side of social media use and fake news sharing behavior among social media users. A large cross-sectional data from 1022 social media users are collected to test the research model, formulated using social comparison theory, self-determination theory, rational choice theory and seminal work on psychology and communication. The study results suggest that online trust, self-disclosure, fear of missing out (FoMO), and social media fatigue are positively associated with the sharing fake news (intentionally). In contrast, social comparison has a negative association. The study findings also indicate that online trust has negative association with authenticating news before sharing. The study concludes with some implications for policy makers and marketers that could be useful in protecting society and brands from the perils of the misuse of social media and fake news.
1. Introduction
Online social media have drastically transformed how information is shared and assimilated by individuals, communities, and firms (Dhir et al., 2018a; Dhir et al., 2018a; Dhir et al., 2017). Globally, firms are using social media to augment their sales revenue by reaching out to new customers and enhancing the existing customers' experience (Movsisyan, 2016; Yadav et al., 2015). Firms not only use social media as a tool for their marketing campaigns (Baum et al., 2018), but also extend it beyond marketing to drive innovation (Torres de Oliveira et al., 2019). However, as extant literature evidences, there is a dark side of online social media as well. The Barilla case provides crucial insights into the negative impact of the social media as the CEO's controversial comments received a negative backlash on social media, plunging the firm into a brand crisis (Coffee, 2013). More recently, Elon Musk's (The CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and The Boring Company) tweets and related Facebook posts adversely affected Tesla's stock price, leading to lawsuits by its investors and investigations by the regulators (Matousek, 2018). Another instance of a brand being affected by news going viral on social media was the Volkswagen case, where many negative comments were made on social media after the emission scandal (Litsa, 2016).

Though, electronic WOM spread across social media can help a firm enhance its reputation and performance (Loureiro et al., 2018; Nisar et al., 2019), yet at the same time, Pace et al. (2014) argue that the exposure to social media intensifies the word of mouth (WOM) and that the reactions of consumers exposed to brand issues on social media are more negative as compared to those exposed through traditional media. Hennig-Thurau et al. (2013) observe that social media exposure has the potential to negatively impact brands since customers have the freedom to share their bad experiences and other issues related to brands. Similarly, Kohli et al. (2015) also argue that social media has the ability to strengthen or kill a brand.

The threat of the viral spread of genuine issues (e.g., concerns and complaints) on social media is quite worrisome, but at least in such instances, the firms can try to resolve these issues to some extent. However, the spread of rumors and issues which are totally fabricated may make firms feel completely helpless, as such situations are beyond their control. At present, the actual and more serious threat is posed by fake news stories spreading issues on social media that are non-existent. For instance, in 2016, threats were made to boycott Pepsi over a viral fabricated statement in social media discussing the hostility shown by PepsiCo CEO to Trump supporters (Gupta, 2016). Another company, New Balance, also had to face the anger of anti-Trump groups after it was falsely named as the official brand associated with Trump's campaign (Gupta, 2016). These instances raise concerns because, in the current era of Web 2.0, consumers play a more active role in the diffusion of marketing information by creating and disseminating electronic WOM via online social media (Mahapatra and Mishra, 2017).

Any fake news shared by the consumers can have damaging consequences by negatively impacting the brand. It becomes a graver concern in the light of the fact that any news, true or fake, can spread like wildfire in online social media and go viral very quickly (Bessi, 2017; Popat et al., 2017). The situation has been aggravated due to the fact that, in many countries, news is now accessed mainly on online social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook (Fletcher and Nielsen, 2017). These platforms have often been disparaged for not only helping, but indeed boosting the spread of fake news (Caplan et al., 2018). The threat of fake news is quite imminent as it possible for firms, governments, and even individuals to generate and disseminate information (or news) to serve their own agendas to a large audience quickly through social media (Chayko, 2017). Facebook and WhatsApp have initiated many measures to prevent the misuse of their platforms for willful spread of fake news. For example, in July 2018, in India, WhatsApp removed the ‘quick forward’ button, started labeling of messages as ‘forwarded’ messages, and limited the users' ability to forward any item to only five groups at a time (Bhattacharya, 2018).

Despite the damaging effects of the spread of fake news on online social media, it is largely not known as to why people continue to share fake news. Our review suggests that prior literature lacks theoretical frameworks on understanding fake news sharing behavior (knowingly or unknowingly) that takes into account the very nature of social media. Recent study by Marwick (2018) utilizes a sociotechnical model of media effects to explain that people share fake news guided by their pre-existing beliefs, media affordances and the structuring of messages. Newhoff (2018) argues that, to better understand why people share fake news deliberately or unintentionally, further sociological or psychological inquiry is categorically required.

The current study bridges this gap as it tries to examine the empirical associations between the dark side of online social media and fake news sharing behavior of social media users. A framework of fake news sharing behavior of consumers was developed by identifying certain behaviors and manifestations associated with social media usage. As fake news sharing is a negative aspect of online social media, it can be anticipated to have association with other negative aspects related to social media use. The disagreeable social media behaviors that adversely impact users (e.g., performance, productivity, wellbeing) have often been referred to as the dark side of social media (Baccarella et al., 2018; Dhir et al., 2018a, Dhir et al., 2018b, Dhir et al., 2018c; Dhir et al., 2016a; Dhir et al., 2016b). Some of the commonly discussed negative outcome behaviors in the context to social media are compulsive social media use (Dhir et al., 2015), social media fatigue (SMF hereinafter) (Bright et al., 2015; Dhir et al., 2018a, Dhir et al., 2018b, Dhir et al., 2018c), fear of missing out (FoMO hereinafter) (Blackwell et al., 2017) and social comparison (Nesi and Prinstein, 2015). In addition to the negative manifestations, the behaviors related to the very nature of social media use were also considered, namely, self-disclosure (Bazarova and Choi, 2014) and online trust (Grabner-Kräuter and Bitter, 2013).

The developed framework was tested with a large cross-sectional data of 1022 WhatsApp users. The independent variables were dark side of social media (FoMO, social comparison, and SMF), and social media use (online trust and self-disclosure). The current study presents one of the first empirical investigations into the association of the dark side of social media, social media use and fake news sharing behavior. The novelty of this study is that it explores the links between some of the key aspects of social media use that have attracted the interest of scholars. However, these associations were not empirically modelled in the past. Furthermore, to the best of our understanding, no prior study on fake news has utilized structural equation modelling (SEM) to model the fake news sharing behavior. The study concludes with some key theoretical implications for researchers and practical implications for managers and policy makers.

2. Literature review
2.1. Fake news
Fake news is defined as online falsehoods formatted and circulated in a way as to make them appear authentic and legitimate to the readers (Mustafaraj and Metaxas, 2017). While fake news has always been present in some form or another for centuries, it is more popular now than ever, as shown by the recent research (Dewey, 2016). The interest of scholars in studying it has also increased during the past few years. A large number of the existing fake news studies are conceptual and qualitative (e.g., Jin et al., 2016; Mustafaraj and Metaxas, 2017; Shu et al., 2017). For example, Mustafaraj and Metaxas (2017) study the details of the use of anonymous Twitter handles to spread misinformation about an electoral candidate, Martha Coakley, to understand the spread of fake news on social networks. The study reveals that the news was spread through the infiltration of groups of users already conversing online in order to use them to share misinformation organically across their networks. There exist several empirical studies as well on fake news, but these are largely based on the analysis of newsfeeds, tweets and Facebook posts to understand the spread of fake news (e.g., Jang et al., 2018; Shin et al., 2018). Shin et al. (2018) analyze tweets representing rumors related to politics that were tweeted and shared on Twitter during the 2012 U.S. election, collected in real time from January 2012 through January 2013. The study reveals that rumor has a tendency to reverberate and resurface many times after the initial publication, whereas the factual news does not come up again and again. Jang et al. (2018) analyze a large number of tweets about both fake and real news related to the 2016 US Presidential election from January 1, 2016, to April 30, 2017. The study reveals that ordinary Twitter users had generated the fake news root tweets, but these tweets included links to dubious news websites. The study also highlights differences between the evolution of real and fake news stories.

Most of the other prior empirical studies are based on text analysis using time series, examination of the root content, writing style analysis of hyper partisan, analysis of sharing history of the identified fake story, evaluation of the information presented in the form of tweets, comments and articles, and randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages (e.g., Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017; Bond et al., 2012; Potthast et al., 2017). In a study based on survey data encompassing 12 US states and 8000 school and college students, researchers found that most respondents were unable to distinguish between fake and real information (McGrew et al., 2018). There is a gap as far as studies related to behavioral aspects of sharing fake news by social media users are concerned.

2.2. Dark side of social media
Social media has a dark side to it which is looming larger by the day, and it is damaging the freedom and wellbeing of communities and individuals (Baccarella et al., 2018). Scholars argue that these platforms promote socially vindictive behavior, e.g., self-promotion, emotional coldness, duplicity, aggressiveness, self-objectification, and narcissism (Fox and Rooney, 2015; Garcia and Sikström, 2014). These negative aspects of social media significantly influence cognitive, emotional, social, and mental health outcomes (ImmordinoYang et al., 2012). Furthermore, negative aspects of social media also pose a threat to our society and the firms at large. Some of the prominent negative impacts include online firestorms and hate propagation (Rost et al., 2016), feeling of being tired at work and work–life conflicts (van Zoonen et al., 2017) and the spread of online gossip or fake news, which threatens the existence of firms (Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017). Given the importance of spreading fake news in impacting firms and consumers, this study aims to explore these associations.

There exists only limited understanding of the association between the use of social media and spread of fake news. For example, Blackwell et al. (2017) suggest that FoMO significantly leads to compulsive social media usage. But, it is not clear if compulsive social media use or FoMO are positively associated with fake news sharing behavior. An understanding of such relationship may provide insights into the strategies that can be used by managers and regulators to protect their brands and cull the viral spread of damaging news online, respectively.

2.3. Online gossips and fake news
In evolutionary psychology, gossip has been described as strategies people use to influence others (Guerin, 2003). Over the years, scholars have maintained that gossip is useful in promoting social cohesion and information transmission (Dunbar, 1996; Konnikova, 2011; Okazaki et al., 2013). The sharing of gossip has acquired a more interesting connotation in the age of Web 2.0. The nature of social media is participatory, whereby people make new acquaintances and strengthen connections with existing friends through online interactions (Dewan and Ramaprasad, 2014). Group protection, status enhancement, social bonding, peer identification, and feeling of belonging to a group may be seen as factors that motivate people to engage in gossip (Boyer O'Leary et al., 2014; Lyons and Hughes, 2015).

Online gossip and sharing of online fake news have some connections as both involve sharing of information. The rise in instances of sharing malicious fake news in social media has become a great concern, especially since a notable number of users rely on social media for news, e.g., as high as 62% (Gottfried and Shearer, 2016). The perils of fake news spread are also highlighted by the fact that, in a recent study, a large percentage of people recalled believing the fake news they saw during the US Presidential election in 2016 (Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017). The volume and speed of information being transmitted on social media make it virtually impossible to detect its credibility quickly, thereby underscoring the urgency of developing efficient systems to spot fake news (Tacchini et al., 2017). Despite this, we still lack exploratory empirical studies examining the different antecedents of sharing of fake news by social media users guided by an intrinsic need to gossip. The current investigation tries to contribute to this scarce literature.

2.4. Theories
Many theories of psychology, theorized well before the advent of social media, seem to explain various aspects of social media behavior quite well. For instance, social comparison on social media can be understood in the context of social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954), rational choice theory (Becker, 1976) and self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, 1985). These theories have been used in the current study to hypothesize relationship between social media behaviors of consumers and fake news sharing.

Social comparison theory (SCT): It was formulated to explain how individuals form beliefs and opinions about their capabilities and the drive they possess to evaluate their own abilities (Festinger, 1954). SCT theorizes that, when people are not able to evaluate their abilities on their own, they resort to comparing themselves with others. Such comparison gives them a sense of validation and cognitive clarity. Furthermore, such comparisons produce more accurate assessments when the target of comparison is similar to the person making the comparison. The theory also discusses two types of comparisons, namely, upward and downward comparisons. Festinger (1954) postulated that, when a person is highly motivated, he would tend to engage in upward comparison, that is, compare himself with people who are better than him. This represents the motivation for self-evaluation and self-enhancement. In contrast, an unmotivated person would resort to downward comparison, considering himself to be the best. The behavior of social comparison has been observed to be manifested in social media use also (Nesi and Prinstein, 2015).

Rational choice theory (RCT): It has its roots in economics, but is also used by other social scientists to analyze human behavior. The theory postulates that individuals make choices that tend to maximize their personal utility (Becker, 1976). Such choices are in their best self-interest possible and are outcomes of well-thought through alternatives and preferences. The theory also implies that the choices are made in specific context and may change with a change in the situation or beliefs. In a pure economics context, the theory considers rational choice to be the result of analysis of costs and benefits associated with each preference. It has been argued that rational choice theory is also manifested in social media use where consumers consciously decide to continue to use social media, anticipating positive outcomes rather than discontinuing its use on account of social media fatigue (Logan et al., 2018).

Self-determination theory (SDT): It provides a framework for the assessment of human motivation and personality (Deci and Ryan, 1985). It posits that people are active organisms who seek to evolve continuously in order to make coherent sense of self. But such natural inclination for growth does not operate automatically and needs social support to catalyze it. An obvious deduction of the theory, then, is that the social context and cultural factors are also capable of impeding the tendencies of psychological growth, initiative and active engagement. This would detrimentally impact the individual's wellbeing and quality of performance. Conversely, conditions supporting autonomy, competence and relatedness can enhance performance, creativity and diligence. In the context of social media, this theory seems to explain a prominent social media manifestation, FoMO. The need for relatedness and sense of belonging has been argued to be the main motivation driving FoMO (Beyens et al., 2016).

3. Research model and hypotheses
A conceptual model was proposed based on the seminal work available in the field of communication and psychology to hypothesize the relationship of the selected antecedents, namely, online trust, self-disclosure, FoMO, social comparison and SMF with sharing fake news and authenticating fake news before sharing online (Fig. 1). As far as the authors know, there is no prior theory-driven study using survey data to examine fake news sharing behavior; therefore, there is no a priori. Consequently, different theories that seemed relevant to social media behavior of users were consulted such as social comparison theory, self-determination theory and theory of rational choice, along with the related seminal work to develop the research model using different aspects of social media usage and fake news sharing behavior. Key constructs and the theories, seminal work and recent studies used to ground the associations between them are presented in Table 1.
